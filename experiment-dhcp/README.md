## Configuration Topology
- [R1]()
-[R2]()
-[R3]()


## Question 

As I have a router with topology and two network interfaces connected to two other routers (R2 and R3), but one of the routers has the IP address of the DHCP server, how do I see that the DHCP server works with both network interfaces?
