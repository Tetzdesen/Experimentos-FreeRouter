- [R2](https://github.com/Tetzdesen/Experimentos-FreeRouter/tree/main/experiment-dhcp/topology/r2)
- [R3](https://github.com/Tetzdesen/Experimentos-FreeRouter/tree/main/experiment-dhcp/topology/r3)


## Question 

As I have a router with topology and two network interfaces connected to two other routers (R2 and R3), but one of the routers has the IP address of the DHCP server, how do I see that the DHCP server works with both network interfaces?
